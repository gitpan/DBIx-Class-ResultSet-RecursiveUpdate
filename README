DBIx-Class-RecursiveUpdate version 0.0.1

You can feed the ->create method with a recursive datastructure and have the related records
created.  Unfortunately you cannot do a similar thing with update_or_create - this module
tries to fill that void. 

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


DEPENDENCIES

See Makefile.PL
